        However, a user might accidentally press a key multiple times in a short period of time due

        duration during which a key will be considered a single key press even if it is hit multiple
        times. E.g. if we have debounce time set to 1 second, then hitting a key 15 times during a
        second would generate only one key press; hitting the key a 16th time exactly one second
        after the first key press would be the soonest that the key press would be considered a
